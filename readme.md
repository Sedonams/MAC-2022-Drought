BB 8/5/25

THinking we should have a data cleanup script so we all clean our scripts in the same way, since there's a good bit of data we need to make sure is all good to go.

Currently working on the above in MAC22_BB.R, once it's in a better state, I'll make that a separate script that can be run.
